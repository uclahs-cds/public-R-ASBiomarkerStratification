Widespread use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening results in 50% of new cases of prostate cancer being diagnosed with low-grade localized disease.1-4 Standard of care for these cases is to defer immediate treatment in favor of active surveillance (AS), a low-toxicity management which entails close monitoring with PSA tests, repeat prostate biopsies and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI).5-8 Around 30% of men on AS progress or electively undergo definitive treatment within two years of diagnosis.8,9 Efficacious low-cost, low-toxicity strategies to limit exit from AS are needed to reduce over-treatment and improve health-related quality of life (QOL).
