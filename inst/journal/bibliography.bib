abstract = {Objectives To explore the utility of Prostate Health Index (PHI) density for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) in a contemporary cohort of men presenting for diagnostic evaluation of PCa. Patients and Methods The study cohort included patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA; >2 ng/mL) and negative digital rectal examination who underwent PHI testing and prostate biopsy at our institution in 2015. Serum markers were prospectively measured per standard clinical pathway. PHI was calculated as ([{−2}proPSA/free PSA] × [PSA]½), and density calculations were performed using prostate volume as determined by transrectal ultrasonography. Logistic regression was used to assess the ability of serum markers to predict clinically significant PCa, defined as any Gleason score ≥7 cancer or Gleason score 6 cancer in >2 cores or >50\% of any positive core. Results Of 118 men with PHI testing who underwent biopsy, 47 (39.8\%) were found to have clinically significant PCa on biopsy. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) PHI density was 0.70 (0.43–1.21), and was 0.53 (0.36–0.75) in men with negative biopsy or clinically insignificant PCa and 1.21 (0.74–1.88) in men with clinically significant PCa (P < 0.001). Clinically significant PCa was detected in 3.6\% of men in the first quartile of PHI density (<0.43), 36.7\% of men in the IQR of PHI density (0.43–1.21), and 80.0\% of men with PHI density >1.21 (P < 0.001). Using a threshold of 0.43, PHI density was 97.9\% sensitive and 38.0\% specific for clinically significant PCa, and 100\% sensitive for Gleason score ≥7 disease. Compared with PSA (area under the curve [AUC] 0.52), PSA density (AUC 0.70), \%free PSA (AUC 0.75), the product of \%free PSA and prostate volume (AUC 0.79), and PHI (AUC 0.76), PHI density had the highest discriminative ability for clinically significant PCa (AUC 0.84). Conclusions Based on the present prospective single-centre experience, PHI density could be used to avoid 38\% of unnecessary biopsies, while failing to detect only 2\% of clinically significant cancers.},

abstract = {The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has issued guidelines for the grading of prostate cancer based on a consensus conference held in 2014. The recommendations resulting from the 2014 consensus conference were a further development of 2005 ISUP modified Gleason grading. In the 2014 system, morphological criteria are clarified, including updated definitions of Gleason pattern 4. In addition to the continued reporting of Gleason scores, we also recommend that Gleason scores ≤6, 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7, 8 and 9–10, respectively, be reported as five groups, i.e. ISUP grades 1–5. This new grading system has the dual benefit of predicting patient outcome as well as facilitating patient communication.},
